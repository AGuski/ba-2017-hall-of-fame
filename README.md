# BA 2017 Hall of Fame 

I'd like to give huge thanks to
## Alina, Siggi, Björn, Paul and the most awesome human being that I know as Kaddi.

This Bachelor's thesis was created in dedication to __Ikutarō Kakehashi__, who died on 1st of April 2017,
just when I was about to start this work. Without him, there would be no MIDI and therefore not this Bachelor's thesis as well.
